# Assignment 1: Web Application Mimicking Google Sheets

## Project Overview
This project is a web-based application that mimics the core functionalities of Google Sheets. It allows users to create, edit, and manipulate tabular data efficiently using a user-friendly interface.

## Features
- Create and manage multiple sheets
- Edit, add, and delete rows and columns
- Perform basic arithmetic operations
- Save and load data persistently
- Responsive and interactive UI

## Technologies Used
- **Frontend**: React.js, HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- **Backend**: Node.js, Express.js
- **Database**: MongoDB (or Local Storage for temporary data persistence)

## Installation and Setup
### Prerequisites
Ensure you have the following installed:
- Node.js (v14+ recommended)
- MongoDB (if using a database)

### Steps to Run the Project
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-repo/web-sheets.git
   cd web-sheets
   ```
2. Install dependencies:

   http://localhost:3000
   ```

## Usage
1. Open the web application.
2. Create a new sheet or load an existing one.
3. Click on any cell to edit its contents.
4. Use formulas like `=SUM(A1:A5)` for calculations.
5. Save or export the sheet for future use.

## Future Enhancements
- Implement real-time collaboration
- Add more advanced formulas and data visualization
- Improve authentication and user management
